# Go Learning Project: Pointers, Structs, Reference vs. Value Types

This Go project serves as a learning repository where I practice concepts related to pointers, structs, and the distinctions between reference and value types in Go.

## Concepts Covered

1. **Pointers:**

   - Understanding how pointers work in Go.
   - Pointer declaration, assignment, and dereferencing.

2. **Structs:**

   - Creating and using structs in Go.
   - Embedding structs and defining methods on them.

3. **Reference vs. Value Types:**

   - Exploring the differences between reference types (pointers) and value types in Go.
   - Understanding when to use pointers and when to use values.

4. **Maps:**
   - Defining and manipulating maps in Go.
   - Exploring common map operations and use cases.

## Project Structure

The project is organized with a series of `main.go` files, each focusing on a specific concept. Below is a brief overview of each file:

1. **`main_pointers.go`:**

   - Contains examples and exercises related to pointers in Go.

2. **`main_structs.go`:**

   - Demonstrates the usage of structs and methods in Go.

3. **`main_reference_vs_value.go`:**
   - Provides examples to understand the differences between reference and value types in Go.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ugurercin/Go-Basics/002-Structs
   cd go-learning-pointers-structs
   ```
