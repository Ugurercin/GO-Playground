# Go Card Project

## Project Overview

This is a simple Go project where I've started learning the basics of the Go programming language. The project involves creating a deck of cards, generating the deck, and dealing cards.

## Learning Goals

I'm using this project to learn and practice the following concepts in Go:

- Receiver Functions
- Custom Type Declarations
- Slices
- For Loops

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **main.go**: The main entry point of the application.
- **deck.go**: Contains the custom type declaration for a deck of cards and relevant receiver functions.
- **main_test.go**: Includes basic tests for the functions implemented in `deck.go`.

## How to Run

To run the project, you need to have Go installed on your machine. Follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ugurercin/go-card-project.git
   cd go-card-project
   ```

2. Run the main program:

```bash
Copy code
go run main.go
```

3. Run tests:

```bash
Copy code
go test
```

## Learning Goals

The primary learning goals for this project include:

Understanding receiver functions in Go.
Defining and working with custom types.
Implementing basic functionalities using slices.
Practicing iterative control structures with for loops.
