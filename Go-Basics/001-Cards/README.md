Go Card Project
This is a simple Go project where I've started learning the basics of the Go programming language. The project involves creating a deck of cards, generating the deck, and dealing cards.

Project Overview
I'm using this project to learn and practice the following concepts in Go:

Receiver Functions
Custom Type Declarations
Slices
For Loops
Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

main.go: The main entry point of the application.
deck.go: Contains the custom type declaration for a deck of cards and relevant receiver functions.
main_test.go: Includes basic tests for the functions implemented in deck.go.
